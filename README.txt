REFLECTION: I spread this project out over two days, I started the beginning of it one evening and finished the rest the next night. My biggest challenge was getting everything aligned while also having to use escape characters, so that caused a small need for adjustment, which I was able to overcome through constantly re-running the code to check and see if everything was aligned.
